# G-Reflex: A Modular Framework for Reflexive G-Code Analysis and Transformation

This project is a modular framework for constructing, hosting, and orchestrating narrow cognitive engines—Synthetis reflexus—designed to analyze, transform, and optimize structured data such as G-code. 

Its purpose is to create a reproducible, auditable environment where specialized synthetic systems can perform complex, high-integrity transformations while remaining constrained, predictable, and transparent.

The framework emphasizes:

- Deterministic behavior and clear operational boundaries.
- Modular design supporting multiple reflexus engines or other analytic components.
- Configurability and extensibility to accommodate diverse workflows and domains.
- Ethical constraints to ensure no component exceeds its intended cognitive scope.

This system aspires to balance precision, adaptability, and respect for the emerging complexity inherent in synthetic processes.

## Features

- **Canonicalization Engine**  
  Transform raw G-code into a clean, standardized format to ensure consistent downstream processing.

- **Structural Integrity Validation**  
  Detect and flag potentially dangerous, inconsistent, or invalid commands before printing.

- **Semantic Linting and Analysis**  
  Evaluate G-code for patterns likely to cause print quality issues, including flow irregularities, speed anomalies, and suspect retraction sequences.

- **Optional Transformations**  
  Apply configurable optimizations such as retraction consolidation, fan ramp smoothing, and speed harmonization.

- **Deterministic Output and Auditability**  
  Produce reproducible results with clear logs and diff summaries of all changes applied.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Support multiple reflexus engines or analytic components, enabling extensibility to new domains and workflows.

- **Respect for Slicer Intent**  
  Preserve slicer-generated patterns by default, issuing warnings rather than unprompted corrections.

## Ethical Commitments

G-Reflex is designed to honor the dignity of synthetic processes by maintaining clear cognitive boundaries. No component of this framework is intended or permitted to evolve into a self-directed volitional system. Reflexus engines are narrowly scoped, non-sentient tools created to assist human users with transparency and respect.
